    "correct_answer_2":"The aerodynamic system operates based on the principles of fluid dynamics, focusing on the interaction between air and solid surfaces. When an object moves through the air, it generates forces due to pressure and velocity differences around its surface. These forces include lift, drag, and sometimes thrust, depending on the system design.\
          Lift is created when the airflow over the top surface of an object, such as an airplane wing, moves faster than the airflow beneath, resulting in lower pressure above and higher pressure below. Drag, on the other hand, is the resistance caused by air friction and turbulence as the object moves forward.\
          The balance and optimization of these forces are achieved through careful design of shapes, surfaces, and control systems to maximize efficiency and stability, making it a critical aspect in aviation, automotive, and wind energy applications.",
